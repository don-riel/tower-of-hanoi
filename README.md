# About

Game is created with React

HTML Drag and Drop API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) was used to create
draggable elements.

This API only responds to mouse events so it cannot be played on mobile devices.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`
### `npm build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
